        <p>What if I told you: nothing of what you might think of is true when speaking about traveling. or at least, for wat regards those who might be your <strong> first </strong> thoughts. Traveling is all about discovering. We heard about this lie very many times didn't we? Well let me tell you: today's traveling has <strong> nothing </strong> to do with discovery. It's about <em> fullfilling </em> an idea of "experience". We all respond to what we think we'll see and what we're prepared to see. And if the trip does not respond to our main ideas, we might feel disillused, unhappy about how we wasted our holiday. <br> But traveling should not be this. It should not respond to heavily taxed means of transport who enrich a very tiny amount of the already ultra-rich part of the world population. It should not respond to that picture we saw of the sunset behind the great Piramids, it should not enrich our interest perfectly knowing the spots we are going to see one by one. <br> The only truth behind traveling today, is that we lost the true meaning of traveling: exploration, discovery, pure and unexpected amusement, gifted either by marvelous and wonderful things we didn't even imagine could exixt, or by such horrific images we blame ourselves for not knowing in first place.

        <p> A country, made of islands (some of which really tiny), that stretches through the Indian Ocean. It's already meaningful to start with this sentence: not impossible to have thought in advance that it's home of many hypocricies, differences, oppostes. This place hosts different islands and in each island life is carried on in a different way than from the others. </p> 
        <ul> 
            <li>Life and social working are connected to the core of the country, the capital Male; in this small island, everything <em> swarms </em> around at the average speed with which a torpedo detatches from a war jet. Everyone seems to be doing something and that he/she must do it immediately...and the moment after...you look around yourself and see many people just, literally, <em> chilling out</em>. It can lead to some confusion, to say some. From Male thousands and thousands of ships, boats and every kind of floating object departs towards the very many islands of the archipelagoes and the nearest country of Sri Lanka.</li> 
            <li>Two other incredibly odd islands, very near one to the other and not too far from the capital herself, make up the core of this country: the <strong>trash island </strong> and the <strong> prison island</strong>. Those two islands are slightly larger than the others island in the archipelago and completely unique: in one of the two takes place the only jail of the country, a big residence to say the truth, completely surrounded by water, something that makes Alcatraz look like a windmill near to a pond. The other one, the trash island, is something so disgusting and incredibly, frustrating real that it shocks whoever sees it. Well, to say the truth, it WILL shock you ever before that. Cause from dozens of miles away, you'll be able to <em> smell it</em>. It hosts no one knows how many tons of trash. Locals tend to burn down some parts of it every day: this is how Maldives deals with trash. In the middle of the Indian Ocean, considered by many a real paradise on earth. Until they see this...oh, well, until they smell and see it. </li>
            <li> The Resort Islands are often very small islands, hardly reaching a hectare. Those places, run by maldivians and more than often europeans/americans (who provided the money to build the resorts in the first place, making accords with the government and some locals), are what we could call <em> non-places</em>. </li> People from all around the globe (but, interestingly, often Germans!) gather here to "relax" and enjoy the beauties of nature. <br> Without flies and mosquitoes, naturally.
            <br> Paying enormous amounts of money, naturally. <br> Not relaxing at all, actually. <br>
            During the day, those islands become almost completely desert: everyone goes on wild and exciting excursions to see the most wonderful and rare creature that inhabit our planet. After an incredibly rich breakfast, everyone launches himself on some fast boats that will bring them to a snorkelling or diving spot. They will return just before dinner time, exhausted and dehidrated, happy to have fullfilled what they come there for, happy that they got what they expected. And payed a crazy amount of money for.
            <li> Fishermen's (and women's) islands: those places are completely unreal. They are completely normal islands, in which life goes on like in every other part of the world: children go to school, people pray to their god/s, public workers work in public offices, some markets sell the stuff everyone needs to carry on their lifes, someone eats an icecream, fishermen repair their nets and boats, someone else builds a boat, some little girls are taking a bath with completely non dangerous reef-sharks, a manta ray stings a little boy, women gossip about the last show they saw on tv, and someone else roams the little island on a motorbike with his girlfriend sitting on the back, searching for some (very hard to find) sweet spot where they can be alone. Everything seems pretty normal, standard..happy. There might be one or two little "resorts" run by the locals (some very standard arrangements that doesn't cost a kidney per week).<br> But then, something happens. Every month or even twice a month. The island changes approach, it completely transforms. Because the rich people who stay on the big resort come to visit the typical maldivian village. And everything becomes a big lie. Suddenly, everything transforms into a souvenir market. Literally everything. The once calm and quiet streets of the island are filled with tourists, who want to <strong>spend</strong> their little time on the island as best as possible: which means buying. Buying something typical. Something they find or think is typical. Something that makes some people, people who behave and think like the author of this web page, very sad and uncomfortable with how things are going on this planet and in the societies that are irremiadiabily ruining it.</li>

            <p> I won't be talking a lot about Indonesia. I'll only say that it hosts one of the most majestic places on earth, environmentally speaking. But it also hosts some of the saddest, most depressing memories in my head. <br> Indonesia is an <em> incredibly </em> long country, spreading from west to east across 1758 miles, home to 33,999 miles of coastlines. The capital, Jakarta, is home to a non perfectly known amount of people. Millions and millions of people constantly roaming the streets like ants on the ground. Some other selling food at the corners, some other carrying stuff by hand or with hand-held wagons. It seems that life in this town is carried on by the roads, as if they werethe veins of the city, carrying its blood, the people. <br>
                Confusing, dirty, humongous, <em> filled</em>. This is Jakarta. <br>
                But not everything's like this of course. Many places in this country are completely empty, desert. A few miles from the main cities can confirm this.
                <br>Travelling is mainly done by boat and airplane. Indonesia has the honor to have created the most imprecise and laggard air fleet to have ever existed in the hole world.<br>
                Some towns are just horrible.I've seen poor people, resting in front of a gigantic market, 9 grounds high, filled with stuff, counterfeit products, piles of trousers, bags, shirts...I've seen people, laying down to the side of the roadway, not moving. Completely not moving. Face down, in an uncomprehensibly uncomfortable way. Not moving, at all. And thousands, and millions of people just passing by them. Just ignoring. I've seen the lack of interest. I've seen a dead body ignored by everyone. I've seen what poverty really is about. <br> <br>
                Just a few miles away, a beautiful hotel hosts those who must pass a night or two in Jakarta in order to continue their voyage. Many masseuses can be found in there. For very low wages, they'll perform very nice massages that'll restore the strength of the tired travellers.<br> hundreds of kilometres away: a village, named town by who knows whom, roams with children playing in the mud of the open air-sewers. Some dogs join into the dirty pit. At the other side of the street, a man is selling three tall plastic bottles filled with a yellow liquid that's told to be gasoline. The air is filled with a strange, strong bad smell. The nose doesn't get used to it even after several hours. <br> In short: many incoherences. Much suffering and bad smell. Definitely one of the most wonderful country I've personally ever seen.</p>

            <h2> Morocco</h2>
            <h6> 28th October 2016 </h6>
            <br>
            <h3> A country full of different colors</h3>
            <p> Talking about my favourite trip ever, discovering Morocco have been wonderful. To start, I'll make a list of those places that have to be seen:</p>
            <ol>
                <li> Todgha gorge
                <li> Rabat 
                <li> Atlas middle-mountains
            </ol>
            
            <p> <strong> Yes, I did not include in my short list the most famous  spots of the country. Yes I did non include Chefchaouen or Marrakech. </strong> </p>
         <p> The country is so full of wonders and marvelous locations, berber villages, mountains, gorges. I decided not to include the desert, neither: one of the worst experiences to be done in Morocco in my opinion. Visiting a real city with real people, a city that includes tradition and multiculturalism: Rabat is the best place to stay and from where you can depart to visit the whole country. I consider it to be the most beautiful and man-shaped city on the whole country. <br> Marrakech?...extremely overrated and moer expensive than pretty much any other town in  Morocco. </p>
